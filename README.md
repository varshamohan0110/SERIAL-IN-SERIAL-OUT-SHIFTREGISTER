**SISO shift Register**

A Serial-In Serial-Out shift register is a sequential logic circuit that allows data to be shifted in and out one bit at a time in a serial manner. It consists of a cascade of flip-flops connected in series, forming a chain. The input data is applied to the first flip-flop in the chain, and as the clock pulses, the data propagates through the flip-flops, ultimately appearing at the output.

The logic circuit provided below demonstrates a serial-in serial-out (SISO) shift register. It comprises four D flip-flops that are interconnected in a sequential manner. These flip-flops operate synchronously with one another, as they all receive the same clock signal.

The synchronous nature of the flip-flops ensures that the shifting of data occurs in a coordinated manner. When the clock signal rises, the input data is sampled and stored in the first flip-flop. On subsequent clock pulses, the stored data propagates through the flip-flops, moving from one flip-flop to the next.
Each D flip-flop in the circuit has a Data (D) input, a Clock (CLK) input, and an output (Q). The D input represents the data to be loaded into the flip-flop, while the CLK input is connected to the common clock signal. The output (Q) of each flip-flop is connected to the D input of the next flip-flop, forming a cascade.

**Procedure**

/*
Step1: Define the specifications and initialize the design.
Step2: Declare the name of the entity and architecture by using VHDL source code.
Step3: Write the source code in VERILOG.
Step4: Check the syntax and debug the errors if found, obtain the synthesis report.
Step5: Verify the output by simulating the source code.
Step6: Write all possible combinations of input using the test bench.
Step7: Obtain the place and route report.

begin
q[0] <= sin;
q[1] <= q[0];
q[2] <= q[1];
q[3] <= q[2];
end
